##Overview
This repository contains the web-service for the Lifesaver project.  This was completed for the University of Western Australia's major CITS3200 assignment.

The goal of this project is to produce an Android application that fetches a list of closest mental health care professionals to the user's current location.

There are three main parts to this project.  The first being an web administration backend to input mental health care professionals into a MySQL database and fetch the Latitude and Longitude of that point of interest using Google's Geocoding API.  The second is a web service that can be polled by a client requesting a list of results from a given latitude and longitude.   Thirdly is an Android Application that will poll the server and display the returned list of professionals for the user.

This repository is for the web service and web administration elements to this project.
