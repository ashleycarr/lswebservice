Installation

Installation of the Lifesaver web service is completed in two main parts.

Requirements:
The Lifesaver web service requires an apache server with PHP and MySQL 5.5+ installed. 
The service will perform much better however in environments with MySQL 7.0+ installed 
due to the advanced geospatial and POSTGIS functions available.

Uploading Application:
This is a simple matter of extracting the application to a public folder available on 
your server.

Installing the MySQL Database, Tables and Users:
Included with the package is a simple MySQL script called "webservice.sql". 
This file contains all the required SQL commands to install the required
database structure.

Using an interface like PHPMyAdmin or the MySQL command line utilities with this
script will allow you to install the required database structure. For example 
type the following into the command line:

 mysql -u username -p database_name < webservice.sql
